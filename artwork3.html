			<h2>Artwork 3 ------ The Promenade</h2>
			<h3>by artist Marc Chagall</h3>
			<img class="images" src="images/The Promenade.jpg" alt="The Promenade.jpg">
			<p>They, and Chagall himself, would surely be glad that one of his most well-loved and most frequently reproduced paintings dates from one of the happiest times of his life.</p>
			<p>Chagall first met his future wife, Bella Rosenfeld, when he was working and studying with the painter and theatrical designer Leon Bakst.</p>
			<p>For the following 35 years, until her death during their wartime exile in the United States, she would be an intensely powerful and positive influence on his development as an artist. Later in life, he would stress her presence in his creative imagination, long after losing her: "She has flown over my pictures for many years, guiding my art."</p>
			<p>The couple married in 1915 and their daughter, Ida, was born the following year. Despite the upheaval of war and revolution in the former Russian Empire, this was a happy time: the 30-year-old Chagall, having earned some critical recognition in Paris and for his show in Berlin in 1914, was starting to develop a name within the Russian avant-garde.</p>
			<p>The end of the previous regime – and the end of institutionalised limits on members of the Jewish community to which he and Bella belonged – would have made this an uncertain but hopeful time in which to be beginning a new life.</p>
