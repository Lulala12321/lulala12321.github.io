			<h2>Artwork 1 ------ Green Violinist</h2>
			<h3>by artist Marc Chagall</h3>
			<img class="images" src="images/Green Violinist.jpg" alt="Green Violinist.jpg">
			<p>Green Violinist is a 1923-24 painting by artist Marc Chagall that is now in the permanent collection of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York City. The work depicts a fiddler as the central figure who appears to be floating or dancing above the much smaller rooftops of the misty gray village below. This work is often considered to be the inspiration for the title of the 1964 musical Fiddler on the Roof.</p>
			<p>The style of this work reflects the avant-garde styles that were common in Paris after Chagall relocated there in 1910, but the subject matter is highly indicative of his Hasidic roots in Russia. This is made particularly evident by the central figure of the fiddler, who was a “vital presence in ceremonies and festivals” due to the Hasidic belief in achieving “communion with God through music and dance”. This specific work, a re-working of a previous painting, demonstrates a degree of nostalgia for his own work. L. L. Zimmerman writes of Chagall’s stylistic influence on the theatrical space his works occupied: “His paintings and theatrical designs, with their complete disregard for the traditional mathematics of space and time, stand out uniquely among the other products of modern artistic and theatrical endeavor.” </p>
